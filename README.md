# Composer template for Drupal projects

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drupal-composer/drupal-project.svg?branch=8.x)](https://travis-ci.org/drupal-composer/drupal-project)

This project template should provide a kickstart for managing your site
dependencies with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

This is a fork of [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project)
which is set up with support for Continuous Integration out of the box.

## Additional features

This fork has the following additions to the original version of drupal-project:

* **Customizable builds**: Different builds for production and development
  environments are created with [Phing](https://www.phing.info/). These can be
  fully customized using a set of configuration files.
* **Behat support**: Behat is included so you can easily test user scenarios.
* **Preconfigured test suites**: PHPUnit is fully set up for running unit tests
  as well as kernel tests, web tests and javascript tests.
* **PHP CodeSniffer**: Check compliance with coding standards with a single
  command, or set it up to scan automatically whenever you `git push`.
* **Travis CI**: Integrates seamlessly with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/)
  so you can automate your tests right from the start. No setup needed!

If you want to know how to use it as replacement for
[Drush Make](https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/blob/8.x/docs/make.md) visit
the [Documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/2471553).

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) 
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/pfrenssen/drupal-project.git some-dir
cd some-dir
composer install
```

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your 
installation.

```
composer require drupal/devel:~1.0
```

The `composer create-project` command passes ownership of all files to the 
project that is created. You should create a new git repository, and commit 
all files not excluded by the .gitignore file.

## What does the template do?

When installing the given `composer.json` some tasks are taken care of:

* Drupal will be installed in the `web`-directory.
* Autoloader is implemented to use the generated composer autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`,
  instead of the one provided by Drupal (`web/vendor/autoload.php`).
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`) will be placed in `web/modules/contrib/`
* Theme (packages of type `drupal-theme`) will be placed in `web/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) will be placed in `web/profiles/contrib/`
* Creates default writable versions of `settings.php` and `services.yml`.
* Creates `web/sites/default/files`-directory.
* Latest version of drush is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drush`.
* Latest version of DrupalConsole is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drupal`.

## Updating Drupal Core

This project will attempt to keep all of your Drupal Core files up-to-date; the 
project [drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) 
is used to ensure that your scaffold files are updated every time drupal/core is 
updated. If you customize any of the "scaffolding" files (commonly .htaccess), 
you may need to merge conflicts if any of your modified files are updated in a 
new release of Drupal core.

Follow the steps below to update your core files.

1. Run `composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies` to update Drupal Core and its dependencies.
1. Run `git diff` to determine if any of the scaffolding files have changed. 
   Review the files for any changes and restore any customizations to 
  `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`.
1. Commit everything all together in a single commit, so `web` will remain in
   sync with the `core` when checking out branches or running `git bisect`.
1. In the event that there are non-trivial conflicts in step 2, you may wish 
   to perform these steps on a branch, and use `git merge` to combine the 
   updated core files with your customized files. This facilitates the use 
   of a [three-way merge tool such as kdiff3](http://www.gitshah.com/2010/12/how-to-setup-kdiff-as-diff-tool-for-git.html). This setup is not necessary if your changes are simple; 
   keeping all of your modifications at the beginning or end of the file is a 
   good strategy to keep merges easy.

## Generate composer.json from existing project

With using [the "Composer Generate" drush extension](https://www.drupal.org/project/composer_generate)
you can now generate a basic `composer.json` file from an existing project. Note
that the generated `composer.json` might differ from this project's file.


## Customize build properties

Create a new file in the root of the project named `build.properties.local`
using your favourite text editor:

```
$ vim build.properties.local
```

This file will contain configuration which is unique to your development
machine. This is mainly useful for specifying your database credentials and the
username and password of the Drupal admin user so they can be used during the
installation.

Because these settings are personal they should not be shared with the rest of
the team. Make sure you never commit this file!

All options you can use can be found in the `build.properties.dist` file. Just
copy the lines you want to override and change their values. For example:

```
# Database settings.
drupal.db.name = my_database
drupal.db.user = root
drupal.db.password = hunter2

# Admin user.
drupal.admin.username = admin
drupal.admin.password = admin

# The base URL to use in tests.
drupal.base_url = http://myproject.local

# Verbosity of Drush commands. Set to 'yes' for verbose output.
drush.verbose = yes
```


## Listing the available build commands

You can get a list of all the available Phing build commands ("targets") with a
short description of each target with the following command:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing
```


## Install the website.

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing install
```


## Set up tools for the development environment

If you want to install a version suitable for development you can execute the
`setup-dev` Phing target.

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing setup-dev
```

This will perform the following tasks:

1. Configure Behat.
2. Configure PHP CodeSniffer.
3. Enable 'development mode'. This will:
  * Enable the services in `development.services.yml`.
  * Show all error messages with backtrace information.
  * Disable CSS and JS aggregation.
  * Disable the render cache.
  * Allow test modules and themes to be installed.
  * Enable access to `rebuild.php`.
4. Enable development modules.
5. Create a demo user for each user role.

To set up a development environment quickly, you can perform both the `install`
and `setup-dev` targets at once by executing `install-dev`:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing install-dev
```


## Running Behat tests

The Behat test suite is located in the `tests/` folder. The easiest way to run
them is by going into this folder and executing the following command:

```
$ cd tests/
$ ./behat
```

If you want to execute a single test, just provide the path to the test as an
argument. The tests are located in `tests/features/`:

```
$ cd tests/
$ ./behat features/authentication.feature
```

If you want to run the tests from a different folder, then provide the path to
`tests/behat.yml` with the `-c` option:

```
# Run the tests from the root folder of the project.
$ ./vendor/bin/behat -c tests/behat.yml
```

### Testing JavaScript functionality

For testing functionality written in JavaScript you can use software such as
Selenium and PhantomJS to run Behat tests in a real browser.

To enable JavaScript testing for a Behat scenario, add the `@javascript` tag to
the test, and make sure the WebDriver of your choice is running in the
background.

#### Chrome

Set the following build property in your `build.properties` file:

```
# The browser to use for testing, either 'firefox' or 'chrome'.
behat.browser_name = chrome
```

Make sure to regenerate your Behat configuration file after making this change:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing setup-behat
```

You can install Selenium and Chrome / Chromium locally on your system and start
Selenium with `java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar`.

However the simplest way of running Chrome on Selenium is using a container.
You can use Docker to install and run it with a single command. This will
download all necessary files and start it in the background in headless mode:

```
$ docker run -d -p 4444:4444 --network=host selenium/standalone-chrome
```

If you want to look at the browser running, you can run the 'debug' version and
use a VNC client such as TigerVNC to connect to the browser (the password is
'secret'):

```
$ docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900 --network=host selenium/standalone-chrome-debug
```

For more information on running a containerized Selenium, see
[SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium).


#### Firefox

Set the following build property in your `build.properties` file:

```
# The browser to use for testing, either 'firefox' or 'chrome'.
behat.browser_name = firefox
```
Make sure to regenerate your Behat configuration file after making this change:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing setup-behat
```

You can install Selenium and Firefox locally on your system and start Selenium
with `java -jar selenium-server-standalone.jar`.

However the simplest way of running Firefox on Selenium is using a container.
You can use Docker to install and run it with a single command. This will
download all necessary files and start it in the background in headless mode:


```
$ docker run -d -p 4444:4444 --network=host selenium/standalone-firefox:2.53.1
```

Note that the WebDriver implementation for Firefox
([Marionette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Marionette))
is not yet complete for Selenium 3, so we are specifying the latest 2.x
version. This will probably be ready soon, when Selenium 3 is out of beta.

If you want to look at the browser running, you can run the 'debug' version and
use a VNC client such as TigerVNC to connect to the browser (the password is
'secret'):

```
$ docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 5900:5900 --network=host selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.1
```

For more information on running a containerized Selenium, see
[SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium).


#### PhantomJS

PhantomJS is a headless browser based on Webkit, which is the same engine which
Chrome uses. You can install it from your package manager, or [download
it](http://phantomjs.org/download.html).

Declare that you are using a Chrome-alike browser in your `build.properties`
file:


```
# The browser to use for testing, either 'firefox' or 'chrome'.
behat.browser_name = chrome
```

Make sure to regenerate your Behat configuration file after making this change:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing setup-behat
```

Now you can run PhantomJS in WebDriver mode, and run your tests. All your tests
marked with `@javascript` will now be executed using PhantomJS.

```
$ phantomjs --webdriver=4444
```


## Running PHPUnit tests

Run the tests from the `web` folder:

```
$ cd web/
$ ../vendor/bin/phpunit
```

By default all tests in the folders `web/modules/custom`, `web/profiles` and
`web/themes/custom` are included when running the tests. Check the section on
PHPUnit in the `build.properties.dist` to customize the tests.


## Checking for coding standards violations

### Set up PHP CodeSniffer

PHP CodeSniffer is included to do coding standards checks of PHP and JS files.
In the default configuration it will scan all files in the following folders:
- `web/modules` (excluding `web/modules/contrib`)
- `web/profiles`
- `web/themes`

First you'll need to execute the `setup-php-codesniffer` Phing target (note that
this also runs as part of the `install-dev` and `setup-dev` targets):

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing setup-php-codesniffer
```

This will generate a `phpcs.xml` file containing settings specific to your local
environment. Make sure to never commit this file.

### Run coding standards checks

#### Run checks manually

The coding standards checks can then be run as follows:

```
# Scan all files for coding standards violations.
$ ./vendor/bin/phpcs

# Scan only a single folder.
$ ./vendor/bin/phpcs web/modules/custom/mymodule
```

#### Run checks automatically when pushing

To save yourself the embarrassment of pushing non-compliant code to the git
repository you can put the following line in your `build.properties.local`:

```
# Whether or not to run a coding standards check before doing a git push. Note
# that this will abort the push if the coding standards check fails.
phpcs.prepush.enable = 1
```

and then regenerate your PHP CodeSniffer configuration:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing setup-php-codesniffer
```

If your project requires all team members to follow coding standards, put this
line in the project configuration (`build.properties`) instead.

Note that this will not allow you to push any code that fails the coding
standards check. If you really need to push in a hurry, then you can disable
the coding standards check by executing this Phing target:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing disable-pre-push
```

The pre-push hook will be reinstated when the `setup-php-codesniffer` target
is executed.


### Customize configuration

The basic configuration can be changed by copying the relevant Phing properties
from the "PHP CodeSniffer configuration" section in `build.properties.dist` to
`build.properties` and changing them to your requirements. Then regenerate the
`phpcs.xml` file by running the `setup-php-codesniffer` target:

```
$ ./vendor/bin/phing setup-php-codesniffer
```

To change to PHP CodeSniffer ruleset itself, make a copy of the file
`phpcs-ruleset.xml.dist` and rename it to `phpcs-ruleset.xml`, and then put this
line in your `build.properties` file:

```
phpcs.standard = ${project.basedir}/phpcs-ruleset.xml
```

For more information on configuring the ruleset see [Annotated ruleset](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.php-codesniffer.annotated-ruleset.php).


## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download?

Composer recommends **no**. They provide [argumentation against but also 
workrounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### Should I commit the scaffolding files?

The [drupal-scaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold) plugin can download the scaffold files (like
index.php, update.php, …) to the web/ directory of your project. If you have not customized those files you could choose
to not check them into your version control system (e.g. git). If that is the case for your project it might be
convenient to automatically run the drupal-scaffold plugin after every install or update of your project. You can
achieve that by registering `@drupal-scaffold` as post-install and post-update command in your composer.json:

```json
"scripts": {
    "drupal-scaffold": "DrupalComposer\\DrupalScaffold\\Plugin::scaffold",
    "post-install-cmd": [
        "@drupal-scaffold",
        "..."
    ],
    "post-update-cmd": [
        "@drupal-scaffold",
        "..."
    ]
},
```
### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull 
request is often a better solution), you can do so with the 
[composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra 
section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL or local path to patch"
        }
    }
}
```
### How do I switch from packagist.drupal-composer.org to packages.drupal.org?

Follow the instructions in the [documentation on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-packagesdrupalorg).
